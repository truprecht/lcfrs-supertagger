# components used for the construction of grammar nonterminals,
# list consisting of:
#   (1) Constituent,    (the top constituent symbol in a chain)
#   (2) MergedChainConstituents, (all but the top constituent symbols in a chain)
#   (3) OldFanout,      (the fanout before transportation of lexical symbols)
#   (4) NewFanout,      (the fanout after transportation)
#   (5) Transport,      (marks nodes where a lexical symbol is transported beyond the subtree)
#   (6) FanoutChange,   (marks nodes where the fanout changed with transportation)
#   (7) ChildIdx,       (the child index of this node wrt. to its parent)
#   (8) CoarseConstituent (constructs nonterminals from the first letter of nonterminals)
#   (9) BinarizationSuffix (the binarization marker and markov. symbols)
